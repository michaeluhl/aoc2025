#### What are we asked to find?

* How many regions can store all of the presents that are supposed to be there

#### What do we know?

* We're given the shapes of presents
* We're give a list of:
  * Area dimensions
  * The counts of presents of different shapes to be fit in that area

#### What can we assume?


### Explore


### Plan

* First cut, if the area isn't bigger than the sum of the tiles, we know that they won't fit
* Next, if the product of the side lengths (each to the nearest multiple of 3) is greater than nine times the total number of tiles, we know that all of the tiles will fit
