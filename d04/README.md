## Part 1

### Define the Problem

The text of the problem is available [here](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/4)

#### What are we asked to find?

How many rolls of paper can be accessed by the forklift

#### What do we know?

* We're provided with a grid marking the locations of large rolls of paper
* Rolls of paper are accessible by a forklift if fewer than four of the eight surrounding locations are occupied by paper rolls

#### What can we assume?

* It appears that we can assume that for rolls located at the edge of the grid, spaces off of the grid do not count as occupied.

### Plan

* Simple stencil on grid problem
* Convert the data to 1s and 0s for easier comparison against the criterion
* Oversize the grid for ease so that we don't have to treat the borters specially
