# 2025 - Day 8

## Part 1

### Define the Problem

The text of the problem is available [here](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/8)

#### What are we asked to find?

* The product of the sizes of the tree largest circuits

#### What do we know?

* The list of the coordinates of the junction box
* We:
  * Connect the nearest boxes to form a circuits
  * Connect the 1000 closest boxes (10 for the test data)

#### What can we assume?

* The real data is much bigger than the 15 points in the test data
  * That's going to make it impractical to calculate the distance between each of the points
  * Seems like it would be good to have some sort of kd tree, but it's hard to believe that the problem requires something as complicated as that
